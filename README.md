## Presentation

Hi there, **Koffee** is a WebExtension aiming to automatically track animes you watch online on supported websites and  provide a netflix-like "continue watching" with a possibility to sync to your MAL profile.
You can start an anime on whatever supported streaming website then switch to another one and keep track of what you have watched.

*this is a WIP so nothing works atm*
